# Vikinger — Social Community & Gamification WordPress Theme (BuddyPress + GamiPress)

## Project overview

Vikinger is a premium WordPress theme built to create modern social networks and community platforms with features commonly expected by today’s engaged audiences: profiles, activity streams, groups, private messaging, social feeds, badges, points and achievement systems. It pairs a visually polished UI with pragmatic plugin integrations (BuddyPress, GamiPress), ready demo content, and clear extension points for custom features.

This repository hosts the theme scaffolding, integration notes, demo import guidance, developer utilities and documentation to take the design from concept → production quickly and predictably.

## Business value & use cases

* Productize communities: monetize with memberships, subscriptions, courses and premium groups.
* Increase retention: gamification (points, badges, ranks) converts one-time users into habitual visitors.
* Growth channels: community-driven content reduces acquisition costs and amplifies organic reach.
* B2B & Enterprise: internal social platforms for employee engagement, knowledge sharing and onboarding.

---

## Core features & capabilities

* Full BuddyPress UX: profiles, activity streams, friends, followers, private messaging, groups.
* GamiPress-ready: points, achievements, ranks, leaderboards and automated rewards.
* Rich user profiles with custom fields and media uploads.

## Getting started — developer & local setup

**Quick local setup (recommended)**

1. Install Local (LocalWP) or use Docker / wp-env.
2. Clone this repo into `wp-content/themes/vikinger`.
3. Install WordPress and activate the theme.
4. Install required plugins: BuddyPress, GamiPress, demo-import plugin (if included).
5. Import demo content (XML) and run widget/menu setup.
6. Configure permalinks and flush rewrite rules.

**CLI example (wp-env)**

```bash
# start a dev WordPress environment
npx @wordpress/env start

# then inside project:
wp theme activate vikinger
wp plugin install buddypress gamipress --activate
wp import demo/content.xml --authors=create
```

> Tip: keep a `dev` branch with a reproducible `wp-env` or Docker compose file for consistent onboarding of developers.

## Admin, moderation & gamification plan

**Admin roles & moderation**

* Default roles: Admin, Moderator, Community Manager, Verified Contributor, Member.
* Moderation tooling: user warnings, content takedowns, report-to-admin flows, bulk moderation for activity items.
* Privacy controls for groups and user profiles; GDPR-ready data export & deletion endpoints.

**Gamification strategy (GamiPress)**

* Points: award for posting, commenting, inviting friends, daily logins.
* Achievements: milestone-based badges for contributions, course completions or event attendance.
* Ranks & leaderboards: monthly & all-time leaderboards to create healthy competition.
* Reward mechanics: integrate WooCommerce coupons or gated pages as prize redemption.

**Operational notes**

* Start conservative: launch with a few badge types and 1 leaderboard. Measure behavior change before expanding.
* Use A/B tests on reward thresholds to avoid inflation of points and ensure meaningful progression.

---

## Data model (high level)

* **users**: id, username, email, profile_meta (avatar, bio, social links), status (active, banned)
* **profiles** (BuddyPress): custom fields, visibility settings
* **activities**: id, user_id, type (post, comment, like), content, created_at, parent_id
* **groups**: id, name, type (public/private/hidden), members[], moderators[]
* **achievements** (GamiPress): id, name, trigger_rule, reward_meta
* **transactions** (if monetized): order_id, user_id, item, status, amount, created_at

---

## Customization & theming guide (expert tips)

* Create a child theme for all customizations — keep upstream updates simple.
* Use WordPress hooks (actions & filters) to extend BuddyPress behavior instead of altering core templates.
* Centralize UI tokens: typography, color variables and spacing in a single `theme.json` or SCSS variables file.
* Expose a lightweight customizer panel for non-technical content editors (logo, primary color, CTAs).
* Build small REST endpoints for heavy operations (bulk exports, leaderboard snapshots) and protect them with capability checks.

## Performance, security & privacy — production checklist

**Performance**

* Enable page caching (WP Rocket / server-level).
* Use object caching (Redis) for sessions & queries.
* Offload media to CDN and enable adaptive image serving (WebP + srcset).
* Lazy-load avatars and heavy embeds in feeds.

**Security**

* Harden WP: limit login attempts, use strong passwords & 2FA for admin accounts.
* Keep WP core, theme, and plugins updated.
* Sanitize user-generated content (XSS protection) and use capability checks on all endpoints.

**Privacy / Compliance**

* Add cookie consent & privacy policy.
* Implement data export (`wp_export_personal_data`) and deletion (`wp_remove_personal_data`) hooks for GDPR.
* Obtain consent for email and marketing; store consent logs.

## Analytics, engagement metrics & ROI tracking

**Key metrics to track**

* DAU / MAU (Daily / Monthly Active Users)
* Retention cohorts (day-1, day-7, day-30 retention)
* Engagement per user (posts, comments, likes)
* Conversion funnel: visit → signup → first post → paid conversion
* Churn for paying members

**Tools**

* Google Analytics 4 + custom events for social interactions
* Mixpanel / Amplitude for cohort analysis and funnels
* Hotjar/LogRocket for UX issues and session replay on critical flows

---

## Deployment & CI/CD recommendations

* Maintain theme code in Git and use feature branches for major changes.
* Use GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) to run linters, PHP unit tests (if present), and deploy to staging.
* Use wp-cli for DB migrations and scripted demo imports during deploys.
* For enterprise: blue/green deployment with database backups and a pre-production read-only mode for migrations.

**Example GitHub Action steps**

1. Run PHP/JS linters.
2. Run unit & integration tests.
3. Build assets (SCSS → CSS, webpack for JS).
4. Zip theme and upload to SFTP or trigger a deployment script.

### Final notes — ship with confidence

1. Publish a 1-minute demo video showing sign-up → first post → badge earned — this converts clients faster than long docs.
2. Start with a lightweight rewards plan (3 badges, daily login points, leaderboard) and expand based on measured behavior.
3. Provide a “Community Playbook” PDF for clients: launch checklist, moderation SOP, and initial engagement ideas (welcome campaign, first-week challenges).

If you want, I can now:

* generate a professional `DEPLOYMENT.md` for staging & production steps,
* create a one-page “Community Launch” checklist tailored to Vikinger, or
* scaffold a child theme starter with WP hooks and demo REST endpoints.
